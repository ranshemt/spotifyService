//Register my application
    Log in on web page to your account,
    this account will be the 'app manager'
    {
        Client ID       =   the app id
        Client Secret   =   !!SECRET!!
        Redirect URIs   =   re-launch the app after log-in
    }
//Authorization Flows
Authorization Code
    access user resources   -   yes
    requires seckert key    -   yes (server side)
    access token refresh    -   yes
//Authorization Code Flow
    Suitable for long running apps
You Do  -   prompt user to login and grant access
You Get -   Access Token (AT) & Refresh Token (RT)
This will be done in server side,
    to keep the secret key integrity

Not interesting right now!!!

What we need from this:
    save the Access Token (AT) in our DB
    save the Refresh Token (RT) in our DB

***
RESHRESH access token

4. Requesting a refreshed access token; Spotify returns a new access token to your app
Access tokens are deliberately set to expire after a short time, after which new tokens may be granted by supplying the refresh token originally obtained during the authorization code exchange.

The request is sent to the token endpoint of the Spotify Accounts service:
